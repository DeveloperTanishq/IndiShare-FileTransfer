# IndiShare-FileTransfer

 Namaste Folks!

This is the file transfer web application. The tech stack used for front-end is html, css & js ; for backend I have used Node.Js , MongoDB Atlas for db connection and various Node Libraries that helped to create APIs.

Flow of Project:

The user opens the link: <link> and redirected to IndiShare Website. 
The user has two options to upload the file they need to share:
(i) Drag the file
(ii) Browse The file.

After that the file gets uploaded and the link is generated to that file which is available for sharing.

Sharing the file also has two methods.
(i) Copy the generated link and share it.
(ii) Send it as email by providing the emails in the form below.
